# Data Cleaning Techniques with Visualisations

This Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide to applying data cleaning techniques, such as identifying and handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data formats. It includes visualisations to help you understand the impact of cleaning on the dataset.

## Features
- **Identify and Handle Missing Values**: Learn techniques to locate missing data and decide on the best strategy to handle them.
- **Outlier Detection and Treatment**: Understand how to identify and handle outliers in a dataset.
- **Standardising and Normalising Data**: Apply methods to bring consistency to data for analysis.
- **Visualising Data Cleaning**: Use visual tools to evaluate the effect of cleaning techniques.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Installed libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## How to Use
1. **Download the Notebook**:
   Save the `Data_Cleaning_Techniques_with_Visualisations.ipynb` file to your local machine.

2. **Open in Visual Studio Code**:
   - Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code if not already installed.
   - Open the notebook file in VS Code.
   - Ensure your Python environment has the required libraries installed.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Execute each cell to follow the steps for data cleaning and visualisations.

## Requirements

####  Virtual Environment and Pandas Setup Notebook
Create a virtual environment to keep project dependencies separate. 
In your terminal, navigate to your project folder and type: python -m venv .venv
``` bash
python -m venv .venv
```

To activate it:
Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate

Once activated, youâ€™ll see the environment name in your terminal prompt.

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn ipykernel 
```
To select the Kernel:
Click the kernel dropdown (top-right of the notebook) and select the virtual environment `.venv.`

## File Structure
- **Data Input**: Load and explore the dataset.
- **Missing Values**: Techniques to handle missing data.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and addressing outliers.
- **Data Standardisation and Normalisation**: Steps to scale and clean data for analysis.
- **Visualisations**: Charts to compare data before and after cleaning.
